GameProgramming For 2022/1

WHAT is this repo?
-> This is the repo for TA to check the game.

WHY is this repo made?
-> In the class of game programming, it is required that students must use the Version control for TA to check 
and record the changes for the game. As there are many labs and assignment. 

HOW I learn from this repo and assignments?
-> This taught we to work with unity and version control. 
Such as setting it up and committing to it.
This was huge step for me as a game programmer as it taught me to be prepared for the industry.
